Welcome to SurfNotification. This is an Android application that allows users to select their favorite surf spots in North America and get push notification ahead of time when the conditions at their favorite spots will be good. It makes use of the magicseaweed api to collect data.

At the moment, it is not pretty. It is nearly fully-functional, but the design is lacking. Fortunately, I will soon be working with someone who is very talented in design and will hopefully be able to get the application looking as pretty as possible. But for right now, it does what it is supposed to and will hopefully prove useful to other surfers like me.

I am hoping to have this put on the Play Store in the next few days and release an update in which the design will be much improved.

Currently, this application can be viewed on the Google Play store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notify.surfnotification
